They appear to be better at prediction and classification in biological systems than do traditional strategies such as logistic regression. This paper provides a practical example that contrasts both approaches within the setting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room. Methods The study population comprised patients with suspected bacterial infection as their main diagnosis for admission to the emergency room at two University based hospitals. Mortality within the first 28 days from admission was predicted using logistic regression with the following variables: age, immunosuppressive systemic disease, general systemic disease, Shock Index, temperature, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, leucocyte counts, platelet counts and creatinine. Also, with the same input and output variables, a probabilistic neural network was trained with an adaptive genetic algorithm. The network had three neurone layers: 10 neurones in the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer and two in the output layer. Calibration was measured using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test and discrimination was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results A total of 533 patients were recruited and overall 28 day mortality was 19%. The factors chosen by logistic regression (with their score in parentheses) were as follows: immunosuppressive systemic disease or general systemic disease (2), respiratory rate 24–33 breaths/min (1), respiratory rate ≥ 34 breaths/min (3), Glasgow Come Scale score ≤12 (3), Shock Index ≥ 1.5 (2) and temperature <38°C (2). The network included all variables and there were no significant differences in predictive ability between the approaches. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.7517 and 0.8782 for the logistic model and the neural network, respectively (P = 0.037). Conclusion A predictive model would be an extremely useful tool in the setting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room. It could serve both as a guideline in medical decision making and as a simple way to select or stratify patients in clinical research. Our proposed model and the specific development method – either logistic regression or neural networks – must be evaluated and validated in an independent population.

Critical Care    April 2005  Vol 9 No 2    Jaimes et al. R151 Introduction Sepsis is the second leading cause of death among patients in noncoronary intensive care units (ICUs) and is the 10th leading cause of death overall in the USA [1]. Despite new and complex therapies, the incidence of sepsis has increased annually at a constant rate over the past 20 years, and there have been no substantial changes in the associated mortality [2]. A tool that could stratify the severity of sepsis from the initial stages in the clinical course would enhance our understanding of this disorder and its management. A simple system designed to estimate the probability of death would represent the basis for improved diagnosis, prognostication and treat  ment. Specifically, such a model, in the setting of the emer  gency room (ER), could guide decisions regarding ICU admission or whether a particular type of therapy should be instituted. The strategy may be developed from the definitions proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians/Soci  ety of Critical Care Medicine in 1992 [3]. These definitions include a generalized process with clinical findings that may represent an initial phase during the sepsis phenomenon – the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although the natural history seems to reflect a continuum through differ  ent stages of an inflammatory response, from SIRS to septic shock [4], an unequivocal linear sequence of events is far from clinically apparent. Thus, classical analytical models, such as logistic regression, are limited in terms of their ability to eluci  date the interplay that underlies the sepsis phenomenon. Advances in statistical methods have supplied the tools nec  essary to model complex nonlinear relationships among many variables relevant to biological systems. Artificial neural net  works (ANNs) are computer programs that simulate some of the higher level functions of the human brain. As in the brain, there are neurones and synapses, with various synaptic con  nection strengths – called 'weights' – for each connected pair of neurones. However, unlike the brain but similar to many computer programs, there is a specific set of input and output neurones for each problem and each net. These input and out  put neurones correspond to the inputs to and outputs from a traditional computer program. The other, termed 'hidden' neu  rones, along with the synapses and weights, correspond to the instructions in a traditional program. Use of ANNs as clinical prediction models has been explored in many areas of medi  cine, including nephrology [5], microbiology [6], radiology [7] and neurology [8]. Thus far, however, we are unaware of their use in sepsis. In this study we present a practical example that contrasts the abilities of logistic regression and neural net  works to predict death in patients admitted to the ER with sus  pected sepsis as their main cause of hospitalization. Materials and methods Study design In this longitudinal cohort study, patients were recruited between August 1998 and March 1999. Starting from admis  sion to the ER, the patients were followed for 28 days or until death. Setting The patients were admitted to the ERs of two reference hospi  tals: the Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paúl and the Hospital General de Medellín. Hospital Universitario San Vice  nte de Paúl is a 550 bed, fourth level university hospital, and is a referral centre for a region including approximately 3 million habitants. Hospital General de Medellín is a 300 bed, third level teaching hospital, and is a referral centre for the metro  politan area. Both are located in Medellín, Colombia. Participants We included patients aged 15 years or older with any sus  pected or confirmed bacterial infection as their admission diagnosis and at least one of the following SIRS criteria: tem  perature >38°C or <36°C; and leucocyte count >12000/ mm3, <4000/mm3, or >10% immature forms (bands). We excluded eligible participants if they, their relatives, or their doctors refused to provide consent to participate in the study, or if they died or were discharged before 24 hours. Ethics committees of both hospitals had previously approved the pro  tocol, and patients or their legal representatives signed an informed consent form. Measurements The primary outcome variable was mortality within the first 28 days after admission to the ER. For those patients who were discharged before day 28, an evaluation of their vital status was conducted in the outpatient control centre or by phone if a personal interview was not possible. Independent variables recorded at admission were as follows: age, immunosuppres  sive systemic disease (ISD; i.e. any of cancer, chemotherapy, steroid use or AIDS), general systemic disease (GSD; i.e. any of cardiac failure, diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, or cirrhosis), Shock Index (heart rate/systolic arterial pressure), body temperature, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, leucocyte count, platelet count and creatinine blood level. Research assistants in the ER collected clinical variables at admission in a standardized manner. Lab  oratory variables were analyzed using standard quality control procedures at the participating institutions. Missing data for continuous variables were estimated with simple imputations using the median nonmissing value. In total, estimation proce  dures were performed in 2.6% (14 simple records) of baseline values. Data analysis and management The procedure for the logistic model has been described in detail elsewhere [9]. Briefly, we conducted univariate logistic Available online http://ccforum.com/content/9/2/R150 R152 regression analysis for each candidate variable, with P < 0.25 being the criterion for acceptance in the model. Collinearity was checked with a matrix of correlations, using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between independent variables. We chose a conservative strategy, with r ≥ 0.4 in at least one correlation as the criterion for multicollinearity. Logistic model assumptions (i.e. no interaction terms and a linear relationship between the logit and the continuous covariates) were veri  fied. Then, a logistic regression analysis, employing a forward stepwise inclusion method, was developed using a P value of 0.05 at entry. This automatic procedure was contrasted with a backward elimination method and with a full model that included all of the candidate variables, in order to confirm the validity and stability of our results. For continuous variables, the cutoff points for changes in the probability of death were explored with locally weighted regression analysis and the lowess procedure [10]. According to the cutoff points detected, dummy variables were constructed and a new logis  tic regression model was fitted with those variables. In order to obtain the simplest score with the same scale within and between ranges of physiological variables and co morbid con  ditions, the regression coefficients were all divided by the low  est one, and then rounded off to the nearest whole number, as the weight reflecting 'risk' for death for each variable. In defin  ing the severity levels by the size of the coefficients, compara  ble severity levels within variables or conditions were grouped together. The global score for every patient in the cohort was calculated and a new logistic regression equation with the score as independent variable was fitted. The model calibration – observed mortality versus that pre  dicted with the score – was evaluated using the Hosmer  Lemeshow goodness of fit test. The test result, under a χ2 dis  tribution, provides a P value in which higher values (P > 0.05) indicate nonsignificant differences between observed and predicted mortality. The discriminatory ability – the capacity of the model to separate survivors from nonsurvivors, with 1.0 and 0.5 meaning perfect and random discrimination, respec  tively – was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Internal validation was done with 2000 bootstrap replications of the model. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata Statistical Software, Release 7.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Using the same input and output variables, a probabilistic neu  ral network was trained using an adaptive genetic algorithm (NeuroShell©; Ward Systems Group Inc., Frederick, MD, USA). The network has three neurone layers, with 10 neurones in the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer and two in the output layer, the latter indicating death versus survival. Of the cohort 75% was used to train the network and 25% was used in test  ing. The training criterion was that 20 generations had elapsed without changes in the minimum error. The general perform  ance of the neural network was evaluated using the ROC curve and the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test. The difference between the two ROC curves – logistic regression and neural network – was tested using the Wilcoxon statistic based on pairwise comparisons [11]. Results A total of 542 potentially eligible participants were admitted during the study period. Nine were excluded because of death (n = 5) or discharge (n = 4) during the first 24 hours. The final study population therefore included 533 patients, 55% (n = 293) of whom were male. Their age (mean ± standard devia  tion) was 48 ± 21 years, and their median hospital stay was 8 days (interquartile range 4–15 days). Overall 28 day mortality was 19% (n = 101), and 14% (n = 75) of the cohort was admitted to ICU. The most common diagnoses suspected at admission were community acquired pneumonia (recorded in 36% of patients), followed by soft tissue infection (17%), intra abdom  inal infection (12%), urinary tract infection (11%) and others (11%); sepsis of undetermined source was recorded in 13% patients. The major pre existing conditions related to admis  sion were trauma or surgery more than 24 hours before admis  sion (21%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12%), diabetes (13%) and miscellaneous others (9%). Of the patients, 45% were free of associated diseases. A total of 283 (53%) out of 533 cases of clinically suspected bacterial infection were microbiologically confirmed, 113 of which (40%) grew on blood samples. The rate of positive blood cultures among the total requested was 27%, and the most frequently isolated micro organisms were Escherichia coli (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%), Enterobacter spp. (6%), Enterococcus spp. (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), non  fermenting Gram negative bacilli (3%) and others (14%). After conducting univariate analysis for the logistic regression, leucocyte count was considered ineligible for inclusion in the model (P = 0.893). The evaluation of collinearity was carried out for all variables using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A significant correlation (r = 0.44) was found between age and GSD (P = 0.0000). Similar correlations, but to a lesser degree, were found between age and Shock Index (r = 0.1453; P = 0.0008) and between age and temperature (r = 0.1940; P = 0.0000). Therefore, age was excluded from the predictor variables. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to the overall 28 day mortality, taking into account GSD, ISD, Shock Index, respiratory rate, temperature, GCS score, creatinine and platelet count as predictive variables. This model allowed us to discard the latter two variables because they were statistically nonsignificant. For the varia  bles respiratory rate, temperature, Shock Index and GCS score, the cutoff points for changes in the probability of death Critical Care    April 2005  Vol 9 No 2    Jaimes et al. R153 were sought by locally weighted regression. The results are shown in Table 1. With the previous values, 12 dummy variables were con  structed considering the first level (1) as the reference value. These new variables, in conjunction with the two nominal vari  ables previously involved (GSD and ISD), were fitted in a new logistic regression model for prediction of mortality. After divid  ing and rounding off coefficients to the nearest whole number, some levels and variables were bound together, namely co  morbid conditions, GCS score, Shock Index and body temper  ature. The final meaningful variables are summarized in Table 2 according to their levels and relative weights. In this way the final scale of severity was a range between 0 and 12. With these data, the score for each patient in the cohort was calculated, and a model that provides an estimate of severity, defined as the probability of 28 day mortality, was obtained. The Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test yielded a value of 7.54 (P = 0.5807). By ROC curve analysis for dis  criminative capacity, the area under the curve was 0.7517. The bootstrapped coefficients for 2000 replications exhibited standard errors of under 10% of those observed in the model, and the values for the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test and the area under the ROC curve in this set were 8.96 (P = 0.4321) and 0.7119, respectively. The neural network included all of the independent variables. Their weight, by the smoothing factor, ranged from 2.65 for temperature to 0.34 for ISD. The Hosmer Lemeshow good  ness of fit test yielded a value of 8.03 (P = 0.475), and the area under the ROC curve was 0.8782. The difference between ROC curves was statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon statistic based on pairwise comparisons (P = 0.037). Figure 1 shows the comparison of observed and pre  dicted deaths with both methods.
